# r_pong
A so-so implementation of pong using macroquad and rust

Written in 2 days with macroquad and my so-so programming skills.

## Controls
Press SPACE to pause/unpause the game.
(Very complicated)




## TODO (Maybe)
Implement physics based collisions
Move draw function to inside the player struct
Add pong icon to window
Improve function that checks if a point was scored
